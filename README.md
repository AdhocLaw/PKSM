## Installation

Download and install the latest release (that is just a PoC for now). This will give you access to the full app, but you will need also [external additional spritesheets](https://mega.nz/#!5kJWQLhS!GSmPt5TCFh0VQEz08vN3lZSiGmx8SFJozc97_Eh8ZCU) to fully enjoy the graphics. You can download a third party additional assets pack (not provided by me) [here](https://mega.nz/#!5kJWQLhS!GSmPt5TCFh0VQEz08vN3lZSiGmx8SFJozc97_Eh8ZCU).
Pictures in the zip file have to be extracted into the SD card at

```

## Compiling

You need devKitPro, ctrulib, sf2d, sfil, sftd and Xerpi's portlibs to be able to compile this.
